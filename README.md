# PGP-Data-Science-2023

Welcome to the PGP-Data-Science-2023 Repository! This repository contains a collection of eight diverse data science projects that showcase a range of skills and applications. Whether you're recruiting for data science, data analyst, data engineer or machine learning positions, explore these projects to see if my skillset suits your requirements!

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: SQL (e-commerce management)**
   - Description: This project is based on the order management functionality of an online retail store in which you are provided with the “orders” database and you are asked some queries related to it. Answers to these queries will help the company in making data-driven decisions that will impact the overall growth of the online retail store.  
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Joins, Sub Queries, SQL-clauses-statements-conditions, MySQL Workbench

2. **Project 2: Healthcare Insurance Cost Prediction**
   - Description: The project aimed to achieve high accuracy in predicting healthcare insurance cost for each customer. This is because customers incur individual healthcare costs based on lifestyle choices and pre-existing health risks. The insurance company seeks a reliable method to predict and estimate insurance costs for all individuals in its database to minimize business risk.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Data Preprocessing, Data Cleaning, EDA, Predictive Modelling, Machine Learning, Model Tuning, Clustering, Linear Regression; Ridge; Lasso; Elastic Net, Bagging Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor

3. **Project 3: Election Exit Poll Prediction and U.S.A Presidential Speech Analysis using Machine Learning**
   - Description: This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Text Mining Analytics, Support Vector Machine; K Nearest Neighbour; Naive Bayes, Ensemble Techniques, Logistic Regression; Linear Discriminant Analysis.

4. **Project 4: Segmentation using Clustering and PCA**
   - Description: The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data.
   1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques.
   2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: EDA, Clustering, PCA, Data Mining, Silhouette Score, Segmentation

5. **Project 5: Predictive Modelling**
   - Description: This project comprises two parts:
   1. The Computer-activ Project utilizes Linear Regression to predict the percentage of time a computer remains in user mode.
   2. The Women's Contraceptive Project employs classification techniques to discern the usage patterns of contraceptive methods among women, providing insights into the factors influencing their decisions on using ontraceptives.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, LDA, CART
   - Link to Project Folder: https://github.com/p1052/MS-Year-1-Data-Science-2023/tree/main/Predictive%20Modelling%20(Linear%20Reg%2C%20Logit%2C%20LDA%2C%20CART)

6. **Project 7: Visualizing Insurance Claims using Tableau**
   - Description: This project explored the art of problem-solving with the aid of visual analytics. Tableau’s data visualization tools were used to create interactive dashboards to provide high-level insights to the CEO of an Insurance company to drive the company's policymaking.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Business Intelligence, Tableau, Dashboarding, Storytelling
   - Link to Project Folder: https://github.com/p1052/MS-Year-1-Data-Science-2023/tree/main/Data%20Visualization%20(Tableau)

7. **Project 6: Forecasting Wine Sales for ABC Estate Wines company**
   - Description: Analyzed historical monthly sales data of a company. Created multiple forecast models for two different products of a particular Wine Estate and recommended the optimum forecasting model to predict monthly sales for the next 12 months along with appropriate lower and upper confidence limits.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Exploratory Data Analysis for Time Series Data, Exponential Smoothing Models, ARIMA/SARIMA Models, Moving Average Models
   - Link to Project Folder: https://github.com/p1052/MS-Year-1-Data-Science-2023/tree/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis

8. **Project 8: Default Prediction and Stock Market Risk Analysis**
   - Description: The FRA project consists of two parts.
   1. Part A focuses on default prediction and financial analysis, aiming to assess a company's ability to meet its debt obligations.
   2. Part B involves market risk analysis, where the mean and std deviation of stock returns are calculated to gain insights into stock performance and volatility. These analyses are valuable tools for investors, financial institutions, and stakeholders in making informed decisions related to creditworthiness and investment strategies.
   - Skills and Technologies Used: Default Prediction, Financial Analysis, Balance Sheet, Creditworthiness
